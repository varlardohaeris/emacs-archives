;;; Commentary:

;; nmcli is a pain to use so here's a simple Emacs interface.

;;; Code:

  "Turn on WIFI."

(defun gnomenm/disable ()
  "Turn off WIFI."
  (shell-command-to-string "nmcli -t -f net-enabled nm wifi off")
  (message "gnomenm wifi disabled")
  (setq gnomenm/enabled nil))

(defun gnomenm-status ()
  "What's the network status?"
  (interactive)
  (message "gnomenm network is %s"

        (unwind-protect

;;;###autoload
(defun gnomenm-flip ()
  "Flip the AP to the last but one connected to.

If you don't have two APs in the history it does nothing.

This is really useful if you switch between a pair of APs like I
do.  I recommend using a keychord like:

 (key-chord-define-global \"90\"  'gnomenm-flip)

See http://www.emacswiki.org/KeyChord for details on KeyChord."
  (interactive)
  (let ((ap (cadr gnomenm-connect-history)))

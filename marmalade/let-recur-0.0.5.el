;;; Commentary:

;; A simplified let-recur mechanic.  Though I have extensive work on
;; full TCO, this is provided as a simple way to achieve one of the
;; most common uses in a direct and simple fashion.  It is not sutable
;; for any case but strictly tail recursive self recursion.

;;; Code:
(eval-when-compile
  (require 'cl))

(defun let-recur--transform (form)
  "Blindly looks for :recur in the function slot of an sexp.
Will blithely transform it in places where it will break your
code.  So don't put the keyword :recur in your code unless you
are certain it is a tail call."
  (pcase form
    (`(:recur . ,args)    
     `(throw :recur (list ,@args)))
    (`(,func . ,args)
     `(,func ,@(mapcar 'let-recur--transform args)))
    (_ form)))

(defmacro let-recur (bindings &rest body)
  "Like `let' but acts as a lambda named :recur, however :recur
will only work correctly in the tail-call position, so this is
only suitable for recursive functions that are guaranteed to be
strictly tail recursive.  Using the keyword :recur anywhere else
in the body will yield undefined behavior."
  (declare (indent 2))
  (setcar (last body)
          (let-recur--transform (car (last body))))
  (let ((arglist (mapcar #'first bindings))
        (args (gensym "args")))
    `(let ((,args (list ,@(mapcar #'second bindings))))
       (catch :return
         (while t
           (setq ,args
                 (catch :recur
                   (throw :return
                          (apply (lambda ,arglist ,@body)
                                 ,args)))))))))

  (declare (indent 1))

;;     (`(nil ,reverse) reverse)
;;     (`((,head \, tail) ,reverse) (:recur tail `(,head ,@reverse)))

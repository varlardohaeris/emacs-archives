;;; Install:

;; Put this file on your Emacs-Lisp load path and add the following to your
;; ~/.emacs startup file
;;
;;     (require 'emacs-profiles)
;;
;; Set a key-binding to open the configuration menu that displays all
;; configured configurations.
;;
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-`") 'emacs-profiles-show-menu)
;;
;; You can also define your configuration as
;;
;;     (emacs-profiles-set-profiles-data
;;         (list '("1"
;;                 "Office"
;;                 (lambda ()
;;                     (invert-face 'default)))
;;               '("2"
;;                 "Home"
;;                 (lambda ()
;;                     (menu-bar-mode -1)
;;                     (tool-bar-mode -1)
;;                     (scroll-bar-mode -1)))))
;;
;; Each item in the list should contain three elements:
;;
;; * Key to be pressed to load the profile
;; * Name of the profile
;; * A function to be executed against the key, the function that contains all
;;   scripts to be executed to apply that particular configuration.
;;
;; Lastly, you can also call `emacs-profiles-show-menu` at startup so that
;; you can choose which profile to start Emacs in when you start it.
;;

;;; Commentary:

;;     You can use emacs-profiles to switch between multiple set of
;;     configurations at a couple of key-presses.
;;
;;  Overview of features:
;;
;;     o   Quickly configure your Emacs to behave in a specific way
;;     o   Groups a lot of toggles into a single window
;;

;;; Code:

(defvar emacs-profiles--profiles-data
  nil)

;;;###autoload
(defun emacs-profiles-set-profiles-data (data)
  (setq emacs-profiles--profiles-data
        data))

;;;###autoload
(defun emacs-profiles-show-menu ()
  (interactive)
  (prompt-you-now "Select a profile to load:"
                  emacs-profiles--profiles-data
                  "Loaded profile: "))

(emacs-profiles-set-profiles-data
 (list '("0" "Stock Emacs"
         (lambda ()))))

(provide 'emacs-profiles)

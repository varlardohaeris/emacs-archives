;; Author: yuhei maeda
;; Version: 0.0.6


;;; Commentary:
;; I have defined a function, ess-R-object-popup, that when
;; invoked, will return a popup with some information about
;; the object at point.  The information returned is
;; determined by which R function is called.  This is controlled
;; by an alist, called ess-R-object-popup-alist.  The default is
;; given below.  The keys are the classes of R object that will
;; use the associated function.  For example, when the function
;; is called while point is on a factor object, a table of that
;; factor will be shown in the popup.  The objects must of course
;; exist in the associated inferior R process for this to work.
;; The special key "other" in the alist defines which function
;; to call when the class is not mached in the alist.  By default,
;; the str function is called, which is actually a fairly useful
;; default for data.frame and function objects.
;; 
;; The last line of this file shows my default keybinding.
;; I simply save this file in a directory in my load-path
;; and then 
;; place (require 'ess-R-object-popup) in your .emacs

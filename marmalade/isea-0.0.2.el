;;; Commentary:

;; This let's you run an inferior lisp mode with a daemomized Emacs
;; process.

;; Just do

;;  M-x isea

;; Supply a daemon socket name (just the socket name, no need for the
;; path) and ISEA will open a comint and send the daemon stuff to eval.

;; If you start a daemon with elpakit then you can use the elpakit
;; daemon list to find a daemon to use. Elpakit has a key binding for
;; isea if it finds it is installed.

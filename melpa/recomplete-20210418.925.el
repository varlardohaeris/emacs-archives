;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides mechanism for immediate completion, running again cycles over options.

;;; Usage

;;
;; A key can be bound to a completion action,
;; to cycle in the reverse direction you can either press \\[keyboard-quit]
;; which causes the next completion to move in the opposite direction
;; or bind a key to cycle backward.
;;
;; Example:
;;
;;   ;; Map Alt-P to correct the current word.
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "M-p") 'recomplete-ispell-word)

;;; Code:

(eval-when-compile (require 'seq))

;; TODO: make this lazy load (not everyone needs to use).
(require 'dabbrev)

;; Internal Variables

;; Notes on the use of this variable.
;;
;; - This stores the undo state such that we can undo and perform a new action.
;; - This is set to nil via `recomplete--alist-clear-hook' when incompatible functions run.
;;
;; Keys are:
;; - `buffer-undo-list': The undo state before execution.
;; - `pending-undo-list': The undo state before execution.
;; - `point' The point before execution.
;; - `msg-text' The point before execution.
;; - `cycle-index' The position in the list of options to cycle through.
;; - `cycle-reverse' when t, reverse the cycle direction.
;; - `fn-symbol' The symbol to identify the type of chain being cycled.
;; - `fn-cache' Optional cache for the callback to use
;;   (stored between calls to the same chain, avoids unnecessary recalculation).
;;   Using this is optional, it can be left nil by callbacks.
;; - `is-first-post-command' Detect if the `post-command-hook' runs immediately
;;   after `recomplete-with-callback', so we know not to break the chain in that case.

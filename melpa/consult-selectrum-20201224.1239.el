;;; Commentary:

;; The Selectrum integration for Consult ensures that previews work when using
;; Selectrum. Furthermore, some minor Selectrum-specific `completing-read'
;; tweaks are applied. This is an extra package, since the consult.el package
;; only depends on Emacs core components.

;;; Code:

(require 'consult)
(require 'selectrum)

(defun consult-selectrum--preview-update ()
  "Preview function used for Selectrum."
  (when consult--preview-function
    (when-let (cand (selectrum-get-current-candidate))
      (funcall consult--preview-function cand))))

(defun consult-selectrum--preview-setup ()
  "Setup preview support for selectrum."
  (if consult-preview-mode
      (advice-add 'selectrum--minibuffer-post-command-hook :after #'consult-selectrum--preview-update)
    (advice-remove 'selectrum--minibuffer-post-command-hook #'consult-selectrum--preview-update)))

(add-hook 'consult-preview-mode-hook #'consult-selectrum--preview-setup)
(consult-selectrum--preview-setup) ;; call immediately to ensure load-order independence

;; HACK: Hopefully selectrum adds something like this to the official API.

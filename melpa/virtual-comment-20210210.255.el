;;; Commentary:
;; * Intro
;;
;; This package allows adding virtual comments to files in buffers. These
;; comments don't belong to the files so they don't. They are saved in project
;; root or a global file which can be viewed and searched. The file name is
;; .evc.
;;
;; * Virtual comments
;; A virtual comment is an overlay and it is added above the line it comments on
;; and has the same indentation. The virtual comment can be single line or
;; multiline. Each line can have one comment.
;;
;; * Install
;; Spacemacs layer:
;; https://github.com/thanhvg/spacemacs-eos
;;
;; Vanilla
;; (require 'virtual-comment)
;; (add-hook 'find-file-hook 'virtual-comment-mode)
;;
;; * Commands
;; - virtual-comment-make: create or edit a comment at current line
;; - virtual-comment-next: go to next comment in buffer
;; - virtual-comment-previous: go to previous comment in buffer
;; - virtual-comment-delete: remove the current comment
;; - virtual-comment-paste: paste the last removed comment to current line
;; - virtual-comment-realign: realign the comments if they are misplaced
;; - virtual-comment-persist: manually persist project comments
;; - virtual-comment-show: show all comments of current project in a derived mode
;; from outline-mode, press enter on a comment will call virtual-comment-go to go
;; to the location of comment.
;;
;; There are no default bindings at all for these commands.
;;
;; * Remarks
;; It's very hard to manage overlays. So this mode should be use in a sensible way.
;; Only comments of files can be persisted.
;;
;; * Test
;; cask install
;; cask exec ert-runner
;;
;; * Other similar packages and inspirations

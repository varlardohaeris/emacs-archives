;;; Commentary:

;; Let's suppose you have switched to an alternative keyboard layout.
;; Chances are you're going to use that layout everywhere, not only in
;; Emacs, so you set it up on the OS level or maybe you even get a special
;; keyboard that uses that layout.  Now suppose that you need to use an
;; input method in Emacs.  The nightmare begins: the input methods in Emacs
;; translate Latin characters assuming the traditional QWERTY layout.  With
;; an alternative keyboard layout, the input methods do not work anymore.
;;
;; One solution is to define a new custom input method and call it for
;; example `dvorak-russian'.  But that is not a general solution to the
;; problem—we want to be able to make any existing input method work with
;; any Latin layout on the OS level.  This package generates input methods
;; knowing the input method that corresponds to the layout on the OS level
;; and the input method you want to fix.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'quail)

;;;###autoload

  "Adjust an input method to an alternative layout on the OS level.

In fact, an entirely new input method is generated.  The
BASE-METHOD describes the new alternative layout on OS level.
The OLD-METHOD will be copied as NEW-METHOD so the layout in
which the keys are laid on the keyboard when the OLD-METHOD is
used with QWERTY will be the same when the NEW-METHOD is used
with that new alternative layout.

BASE-METHOD, OLD-METHOD, and NEW-METHOD are strings—names of
input methods, they all must be different.

This function uses Quail (and assumes that all input methods are
defined with it), but it does not select the new package."

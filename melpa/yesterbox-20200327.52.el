;;; Commentary:

;; The `yesterbox' approach to handling email is to focus on
;; reading/replying to messages sent yesterday (a finite number),
;; rather than trying to keep up with today's email (a moving target).

;; This mode assumes that you use the excellent `mu4e' mail program,
;; but could be adapted to work with other Emacs mailers.

;; When you call `M-x yesterbox', you will see a new *yesterbox*
;; buffer containing something like:
;;
;; Days  Count
;;    1     19
;;    2      5
;;    3      7
;;  4-6     13
;; 7-10     21

;; This shows that there are 19 messages in the inbox from yesterday
;; (1 day ago), 5 messages from 2 days ago and so on.  The last entry
;; shows that there are 21 messages aged between 7 and 10 days
;; inclusive.  If you then wish to see those 19 messages from
;; yesterday, just press RETURN on the corresponding line.

;; The days for which yesterbox will search can be changed by updating
;; the variable `yesterbox-days'.  If you wish to see the number of
;; messages from today you can include 0 in that list, but then you
;; might be tempted to work on today's messages...

;; The program also assumes your primary inbox is called "inbox";
;; change the variable `yesterbox-inbox' if you use a different
;; name.  Setting the variable to "inbox/" (note the final forward
;; slash) will search for the pattern "inbox" and look for emails in
;; multiple accounts.  See https://github.com/sje30/yesterbox/issues/1
;; for details.

;; Acknowledgements: Thanks to Laurent Gatto for testing and feedback.

;; TODO:
;; When quitting the search buffer, maybe return to *yesterbox* rather
;; than the mu main header.  Remember window configuration?

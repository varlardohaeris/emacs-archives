Requirements
------------

 - Emacs 24.4
 - seq 2.20 (part of Emacs 25 and later)


Exporting
---------

Earlier versions of Fountain Mode had export functionality, but this was
not very good and is better handled via interfacing with external shell
tools, such as:

 - [afterwriting](https://github.com/ifrost/afterwriting-labs/blob/master/docs/clients.md) (JavaScript)
 - [Wrap](https://github.com/Wraparound/wrap) (Go)
 - [screenplain](https://github.com/vilcans/screenplain) (Python 3)
 - [Textplay](https://github.com/olivertaylor/Textplay) (Ruby, requires PrinceXML for PDF)

The option fountain-export-command-profiles provides some shell
commands to interface with these tools, but you are encouraged to edit
or completely replace these to suit your own needs. The format is simple
while still allowing for a lot of flexibility.

This package enables automatic visibility toggling of various Org elements depending on cursor position.
Automatic toggling of elements may be enabled by setting `org-appear-autoemphasis',
`org-appear-autolinks', and `org-appear-autosubmarkers' custom variables to non-nil.
By default, only `org-appear-autoemphasis' is enabled.
If Org mode custom variables that control visibility of emphasis markers, links,
or sub/superscripts are configured to show hidden parts,
the respective `org-appear' settings do not have an effect.

;; URL: https://github.com/jdtsmith/abridge-diff
;; Version: 0.0.2
;; Keywords: magit, diffs, tools
;; Prefix: abridge-diff
;; Separator: -

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; A simple Emacs package for abridging refined diff hunks (for
;; example in magit).  Why abridge a diff hunk?  Most diffs are line
;; based.  If you are working on files with very long lines, for
;; example LaTeX files, or text files with full paragraphs per line
;; (often using `visual-line-mode`), line-based diffs can be very
;; challenging to read, even with "hunk refining" enabled
;; (highlighting the words which changed).
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; Once installed and enabled , abridge-diff will immediately start
;; abridging all refined (word-change-highlighted) diff hunks,
;; shortening them by replacing unnecessary surround context with
;; ellipses (...) . You can enable and disable showing the abridged
;; version using abridge-diff-toggle-hiding.  If magit is installed,
;; abridge-diff automatically configures itself to work with it,
;; adding a new `D a' diff setup command to toggle the abridging in
;; diff and status buffers.  Hunks are shown as abridged by default.
;;
;; Settings:
;;
;; You can customize settings with these variables; just M-x
;;  customize-group abridge-diff (with [default value]):
;;
;;  abridge-diff-word-buffer [3]: Minimum number of words to preserve
;;    around refined regions.
;;
;;  abridge-diff-first-words-preserve [4]: Keep at least this many
;;    words visible at the beginning of an abridged line with refined
;;    diffs.
;;
;;  abridge-diff-invisible-min [5]: Minimum region length (in
;;    characters) between refined areas that can be made invisible.
;;
;;  abridge-diff-no-change-line-words [12]: Number of words to keep at
;;    the beginning of a line without any refined diffs.

(require 'xwwp-follow-link)
(require 'ivy)

(defclass xwwp-follow-link-completion-backend-ivy (xwwp-follow-link-completion-backend) ())

(cl-defmethod xwwp-follow-link-candidates ((_ xwwp-follow-link-completion-backend-ivy))
  (with-current-buffer (ivy-state-buffer ivy-last)
    (let* ((collection (ivy-state-collection ivy-last))
           (current (ivy-state-current ivy-last))
           (candidates (ivy--filter ivy-text ivy--all-candidates))
           (result (cons current candidates)))
      (seq-map (lambda (c) (cdr (nth (get-text-property 0 'idx c) collection))) result))))

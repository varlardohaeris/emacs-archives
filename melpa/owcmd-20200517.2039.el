;;; Commentary:

;; owcmd.el provides a command to switch to the next window, run a
;; command, then switch back to the original window automatically.  Use
;; it to save keystrokes when you need to do just one thing in the other
;; window, like scroll the buffer, jump to a definition, paste some text,
;; or quit a temporary buffer.  It is a sort of generalization of the
;; built-in commands `scroll-other-window' and `scroll-other-window-down'.
;;
;; This commentary provides a getting-started guide.  For additional
;; details including alternative packages and information for
;; contributors, see the README file at this package's homepage URL.
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; Put owcmd.el somewhere in your `load-path', then load it.
;;
;;   (require 'owcmd)
;;
;; Quickstart:
;;
;; To use the package, just bind the command `owcmd-execute-other-window'
;; to some key combination and you're ready to go.  No minor mode is
;; used.
;;
;;   (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c w") #'owcmd-execute-other-window)
;;
;; If you're using Evil, the following binding is recommended:
;;
;;   (evil-global-set-key 'normal (kbd "C-w C-e") #'owcmd-execute-other-window)
;;
;; Now every time you press the shortcut key, Emacs will temporarily
;; select the next window until you run another command.  You can press
;; the shortcut key multiple times to select a different target window.
;; Try this now, assuming you bound "C-c w" as above:
;;
;;   - Open a file containing at least 5 lines and move point to line 1.
;;   - Type "C-x 2" to split the current window.
;;   - Type "C-c w <down>" to move point down one line in the other
;;     window (i.e., the window just opened).
;;   - Type "C-c w C-u 3 <down>" to move point down three more lines in
;;     the other window.
;;   - Type "C-x 2" to split the first window again.
;;   - Type "C-c w" several times to cycle through the open windows, then
;;     type a movement key to move point in the selected window.  Do this
;;     again, this time selecting a different window.  Notice that the
;;     original window gets reselected each time.
;;
;; As this example shows, prefix arguments are supported by default.
;;
;; Configuration:
;;
;; You can configure the package's behavior through variables whose
;; names are prefixed with "owcmd-".  Here is one suggested
;; customization to try:
;;
;;   ;; Use C-g to abort owcmd and stay in the selected window.

the actual command name can't be checked in a post-command hook.
For ignoring other commands that aren't prefix commands, you
should generally use `owcmd-ignore-commands'."

(defun owcmd-execute-other-window ()
  "Switch to the next window, switching back after the next command.

Running `owcmd-execute-other-window' multiple times in sequence causes
the window selection to cycle through available windows, similar to what
`other-window' does.  The original window selection (i.e., the window
that was selected when `owcmd-execute-other-window' was run the first
time) is preserved and is reselected after any other command completes.

By default, reselection of the original window is suppressed after a
command other than `owcmd-execute-other-window' changes the window
selection.  This behavior is configurable using
`owcmd-cancel-reselect-on-new-window'.  Reselection is also suppressed if
the command just run is present in the list
`owcmd-cancel-reselect-commands'.

Ignoring commands:

`owcmd-execute-other-window' can ignore certain commands so that they
neither trigger reselection of the original window, nor end the current
excursion into the other window.  For example, one would usually like to
ignore a prefix argument and switch back to the original window only
after the command that receives the prefix argument has executed.  Two
configuration variables are provided for ignoring commands,
`owcmd-ignore-commands' and `owcmd-ignore-prefix-commands'.

The minibuffer is disregarded for purposes of determining the next
window.  Additionally, any commands that complete while the minibuffer
window is selected are ignored, just as though they were listed in
`owcmd-ignore-commands'.  (If this were not the case, commands like
`eval-expression' would not work properly because any minibuffer editing
would trigger reselection of the original window.)

If you wrap `owcmd-execute-other-window' in another command, you should
add that command's name to `owcmd-ignore-commands'.

Notes about interaction with specific Emacs features:

`execute-extended-command'.  You may observe a 4s delay in
returning to the original window after executing a command via
`execute-extended-command' (bound to \\<global-map>\\[execute-extended-command]).  If you type text or
run any other command during the delay, the original window will
be reselected immediately, so this issue should not interrupt
your workflow.  (The odd behavior is due to an implementation
quirk of the way `execute-extended-command' displays suggested
keybindings for the command just run.  It is likely to be fixed
in a future version of Emacs.)

Incremental search.  By default, owcmd ignores most incremental
search commands (`isearch-forward' etc.), so that you can
complete a full search \"session\" in the other window before
jumping back.  Normally in Emacs, if you execute some other
command like cursor movement during your search, that command
causes the search to end.  Under owcmd, this is also true; just
be aware that this \"extra\" command will be executed in the
current window, and only afterwards will the original window will
be reselected.  If you wish to exit a search session and jump
back without taking any action, use `isearch-exit' (bound to \\<isearch-mode-map>\\[isearch-exit])
or `keyboard-quit' (bound to \\<global-map>\\[keyboard-quit]), which owcmd does not ignore by
default.

`query-replace', `query-replace-regexp'.  Query replacement
behaves similarly to incremental search, except that there's no
dedicated exit command, so owcmd has no way to tell when the
replacement is finished.  Thus, the next command after
replacement will execute in the current window.  You should use
`keyboard-quit' (bound to \\<global-map>\\[keyboard-quit])), or some other innocuous
command, to return to the original window.

`select-window'.  owcmd selects windows using `select-window'
with the NORECORD argument set to nil.  Thus, any actions that
trigger on new window selection are likely to be triggered when
using `owcmd-execute-other-window', both when the other window is
selected and again when the original window is reselected."

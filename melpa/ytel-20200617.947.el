;;; Commentary:

;; This package provide a major mode to search YouTube videos via an elfeed-like
;; buffer.  Information about videos displayed in this buffer can be extracted
;; and manipulated by user-defined functions to do various things such as:
;; - playing them in some video player
;; - download them
;; The limit is the sky.
;;
;; ytel works by querying YouTube via the Invidious apis (learn more on that here:
;; https://github.com/omarroth/invidious).

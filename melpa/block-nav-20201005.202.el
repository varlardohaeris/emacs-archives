;;; Commentary:
;; Provides a number of interactive functions for easily navigating
;; between blocks of code at the same level of indentation.
;;
;; This package does not bind any keys for you.
;; Here are some example bindings for evil-mode:
;;
;;   (define-key evil-motion-state-map "H" 'block-nav-previous-indentation-level)
;;   (define-key evil-motion-state-map "J" 'block-nav-next-block)
;;   (define-key evil-motion-state-map "K" 'block-nav-previous-block)
;;   (define-key evil-motion-state-map "L" 'block-nav-next-indentation-level)
;;
;;   ;; Although this may not be desirable since it overrides vim keys you may use.

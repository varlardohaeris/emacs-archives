# Side Notes #

Quickly display your quick side notes in quick side window.

Side notes live in a file in the current directory or any parent
directory thereof and is displayed in a side window with
side-notes-toggle-notes. The filename to look for is defined by user
option side-notes-file, which defaults to "notes.txt".

To really mix things up, there's the optional
side-notes-secondary-file, which, when non-nil, will display a
separate notes file in a lower side window when the command
side-notes-toggle-notes is prefixed with an argument (C-u).

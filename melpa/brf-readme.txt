This package is not an emulation of the old DOS editor `Brief', but
rather provides an implementation of specific features that I miss
from `Brief'.  Principally these are:

* Line-mode cut and paste.
* Column-mode cut and paste.
* Fully reversible paging and scrolling.
* Temporary bookmarks.
* Cursor motion undo.
* Easy window management.

See README.md or Info manual for further details.

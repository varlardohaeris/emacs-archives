;; Purpose:
;;
;;  Interactively find and clean up unused IDs of org-id.
;;  The term 'unused' refers to IDs, that have been created by org-id
;;  regularly, but are now no longer referenced from anywhere within in org.
;;  This might e.g. happen by deleting a link, that once referenced such an id.
;;
;;  Normal usage of org-id does not lead to a lot of such unused IDs, and
;;  org-id does not suffer much from them.
;;
;;  However, some usage patterns or packages (like org-working-set) may
;;  produce a larger number of such unused IDs; in such cases it might be
;;  helpful to clean up with org-id-cleanup.
;;
;; Setup:
;;
;;  org-id-cleanup should be installed with package.el
;;

;;; Change Log:

;;   Version 1.5
;;
;;   - Scan more files for IDs
;;   - Write list of files to log
;;   - Offer to revert all changes
;;   - More hints
;;
;;   Version 1.4
;;
;;   - Clarification regarding archives
;;   - Rely on org-id-files
;;   - Refactoring
;;
;;   Version 1.3
;;
;;   - Write a log of deleted IDs
;;
;;   Version 1.2
;;
;;   - Adding tests
;;   - Preparing for melpa
;;
;;   Version 1.1
;;
;;   - Respecting attachments
;;   - Refactoring
;;
;;   Version 1.0
;;
;;   - Initial Version

  "Interactively find and clean up unused IDs of org-id.
The term 'unused' refers to IDs, that have been created by org-id
regularly, but are now no longer referenced from anywhere within in org.
This might e.g. happen by deleting a link, that once referenced such an id.

Normal usage of org-id does not lead to a lot of such unused IDs, and
org-id does not suffer much from them.

However, some usage patterns or packages (like org-working-set) may
produce a larger number of such unused IDs; in such cases it might be
helpful to clean up with org-id-cleanup.

This is version 1.5.7 of org-id-cleanup.el.

This assistant is the only interactive function of this package.
Detailed explanations are shown in each step; please read them
carefully and then operate the relevant buttons."

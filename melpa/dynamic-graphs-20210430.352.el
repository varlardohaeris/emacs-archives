;;; Commentary:

;; Make dynamic graphs: take a graph (as defined for graphviz), apply
;; some filters, and display it as an image.  The graph can be either
;; a function that inserts the graph (and is called for each
;; redisplay), or a buffer that can change.  An imap file is created
;; in addition to the image so that clicks on image can be related to
;; individual nodes (TODO: only for rectangles so far)
;;
;; The filters can apply both enhancing operations (add colors, ...)
;; and more complicated operations coded in gvpr.  As a special case
;; there is a filter that removes all nodes that are more distant than
;; a parameter from a root node.
;;
;; The image is displayed with a specialized minor mode.
;; Predefined key bindings on the displayed image in this mode include:
;; - e (dynamic-graphs-set-engine) change grahviz engine (dot, circo, ...)
;; - c (dynamic-graphs-remove-cycles) change whether cycles are removed
;; - 1-9 (dynamic-graphs-zoom-by-key) set maximum displayed distance from a root node
;; - mouse-1 (dynamic-graphs-shift-focus-or-follow-link) shift root
;;   node or follow link defined in imap file - that is, in URL
;;   attribute of the node.  Link is followed by customizable
;;   function, by default `browse-url' - but
;;   `org-link-open-from-string' might be more useful.  See docstring
;;   for details.
;;
;; Example:
;;
;; (dynamic-graphs-display-graph "test" nil
;;		   (lambda ()
;;		     (insert "digraph Gr {A->B B->C C->A A->E->F->G}"))
;;		   '(2 remove-cycles "N {style=\"filled\",fillcolor=\"lightgreen\"}"
;;                   node-refs boxize))

This should be list of filters.

 Each filter can be:
- a string that denotes either name of a gvpr file to be applied or
  direct gvpr transformation,
- an integer that denotes that only nodes with distance from root less
  or equal to the number should be kept,
- symbol `remove-cycles' that causes cycles removal,

The variable is set buffer-local in the image buffers so that it can
be changed dynamically.

The default value somewhat arbitrarily sets kept distance to 3; this

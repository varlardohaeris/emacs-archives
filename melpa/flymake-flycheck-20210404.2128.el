;; WARNING: EARLY PREVIEW CODE, SUBJECT TO CHANGE

;; This package provides support for running any flycheck checker as a
;; flymake diagnostic backend.  The effect is that flymake will
;; control when the checker runs, and flymake will receive its errors.

;; For example, to enable a couple of flycheck checkers in a bash
;; buffer, the following code is sufficient:

;;     (setq-local flymake-diagnostic-functions
;;                 (list (flymake-flycheck-diagnostic-function-for 'sh-shellcheck)
;;                       (flymake-flycheck-diagnostic-function-for 'sh-posix-bash)))

;; In order to add diagnostic functions for all checkers that are
;; available in the current buffer, you can use:

;;     (setq-local flymake-diagnostic-functions (flymake-flycheck-all-chained-diagnostic-functions))

;; but note that this will disable any existing flymake diagnostic
;; backends.

;; Some caveats:

;; * Flycheck UI packages will have no idea of what the checkers are
;;   doing, because they are run without flycheck's coordination.
;; * Flycheck's notion of "chained checkers" is not handled
;;   automatically, so although multiple chained checkers can be used,
;;   they will all be executed simultaneously even if earlier checkers
;;   fail.  This could either be considered a feature, or lead to
;;   redundant confusing messages.

;;; Code:

(require 'flycheck)
(require 'flymake)

(defvar flymake-flycheck-debug nil
  "When non-nil, output some debug messages.")

(defun flymake-flycheck--debug (msg &rest args)
  "Outputs debug messages if `flymake-flycheck-debug' is non-nil.
MSG and ARGS are passed to `message'."

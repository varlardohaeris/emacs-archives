About outshine

Outshine attempts to bring the look&feel of Org-mode to the (GNU
Emacs) world outside of the Org major-mode. It is an extension of
outline-minor-mode (Org-mode itself derives from outline-mode),
that should act as a silent replacement of Outline.  Just change
all your calls to `outline-minor-mode' into `outshine-mode'.

Outshine is major-mode agnostic. At least in theory, it should work
out-of-the-box with all major-modes, even those not yet written, as
long as these modes have comment syntax defined. In real life there
are some major-modes where outshine just works, others that need
some minor tweaks to make outshine work, and a few that need
special handling.

An outshine file is structured just like an org file, only that the
headlines are outcommented with the current major-mode's comment
syntax. We call these outcommented org headers 'outshine
headers'. The different headline levels are fontified like in
Org-mode, and many of the outline-navigation, visibility cycling
and structure editing commands known from Org-mode work in outshine
too. An Org-mode user will feel right at home in an outshine
buffer, the look&feel should be pretty similar, only the
keybindings differ. Since outshine extends a minor-mode it has to
avoid conflicts with major-mode keymaps by using a rather unusual
prefix that is still easy to type (M-#). But the Org-mode
speed-commands have been ported to outshine too, and they use
exactly the same (one-key) bindings like in Org-mode.

There is a distinction between the library 'outshine.el' and the
'Outshine Project' (or 'Outshine Suite') which contains 3
libraries:

 - outshine.el :: The core library.  To use it, simply call
                  `outshine-mode' instead of `outline-minor-mode'.

 - outorg.el :: Major-mode for toggling between the
                programming-mode view and the org-mode view of
                outshine buffers, i.e. buffers structured with
                outshine headers that have outline-minor-mode with
                outshine extensions activated.

 - navi-mode.el :: Occur-based major-mode for super-fast
                   buffer-navigation and buffer-remote-control with
                   one-key-bindings from an associated read-only
                   *Navi* buffer. Navi-mode allows to have the
                   (outshine- or org-) buffer overview side by side
                   with the buffer details, and it gives many
                   different kinds of overviews (these views are
                   actually customizable). With point in the *Navi*
                   overview buffer, many actions in the associated
                   original (outshine- or org-) buffer can be
                   triggered without leaving the *Navi* buffer.


Note that there is a fourth library 'poporg.el' from Fran√ßois
Pinard, which allows to edit function docstrings in temporary
Org-mode buffers and thus nicely complements 'outorg.el'.

Together these libraries enable a lightweight kind of 'literate
programming' that turns the usual implementation of the concept
upside-down: instead of using a text-mode as default and taking
extra action to edit and execute source-code, with Outshine the
programming-mode is the default mode and the text-mode
(i.e. Org-mode) only called when needed. This is much simpler, it
treats Org-mode and Programming-mode simply as two different views
on the same (outshine) file while making it easy to switch between
these views.

History and Credits

The outshine.el library merges, modifies and extends two existing
extension-libraries for `outline' (minor) mode: `outline-magic' (by
Carsten Dominik) and `out-xtra' (by Per Abrahamsen). It offers all the
functionality of `outline-magic' (with some tiny changes and fixes)
and parts of the functionality of `out-xtra', together with many new
features and ideas.

See `outline-magic.el' (https://github.com/tj64/outline-magic) for
detailled instructions on the usage of the additional outline
functions introduced by `outline-magic'.

Furthermore, `outshine.el' includes some functions and keybindings
from `outline-mode-easy-bindings'
(http://emacswiki.org/emacs/OutlineMinorMode).  Unfortunately, no
author is given for that library, so I cannot credit the person who
wrote it.

Installation

There are three ways to get outshine.el (and the other Outshine
libraries):

 1. Clone the git repo or fork them on github
    (https://github.com/alphapapa/outshine)

 2. Use the package manager to install them (from MELPA).

 3. Simply download the raw .el files from github and copy them to
    a location where Emacs can find them. This is not really
    recommended, since easy updating is not possible this way.

Note that since version 2.0, outshine.el depends on outorg.el and
navi-mode.el depends on both, outshine.el and outorg.el. So the order
of installation should be

 1. outorg
 2. outshine
 3. navi-mode (optional)

To get started, simply start Outshine with `M-x outshine-mode RET'

Add this to your init file if you always want outshine for emacs-lisp
buffers (recommended):

: #+begin_src emacs-lisp
:   (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'outshine-mode)
: #+end_src

It makes sense to add 'outline-minor-mode' to the hooks of other
major-modes too, e.g.

: #+begin_src emacs-lisp
:  (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'outshine-mode)
:  (add-hook 'picolisp-mode-hook 'outshine-mode)
:  (add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook 'outshine-mode)
:  (add-hook 'ess-mode-hook 'outshine-mode)
:  (add-hook 'ledger-mode-hook 'outshine-mode)
:  (add-hook 'message-mode-hook 'outshine-mode)
: #+end_src

or whatever your favorite Emacs modes are. Then you can structure and
handle all your source-files just like Org files, allowing for a
uniform approach to file structuring independent from the (text or
programming) mode.

Outline(-minor)-mode comes with a rather unusable prefix key
out-of-the-box. You need to set the outshine prefix (M-#) in your init
file before (!) outline-mode is loaded to enable the outshine
keybindings:

: #+begin_src emacs-lisp
:  (defvar outline-minor-mode-prefix "\M-#")
: #+end_src

Usage

Basic Usage

The outshine.el extensions to outline-minor-mode aim to make its
use more similar to Org-mode. Given a correctly structured outshine
buffer, outline-navigation, structure-editing and visibility
cycling with outshine should make an Org-mode user feel right at
home.

Try C-h m (describe-mode) and C-h b (describe-bindings) in an
outshine buffer to find out more about the available functions and
their keybindings.

The very useful Org speed-commands have been ported to outshine,
here a quote from the
[[http://orgmode.org/manual/Speed-keys.html][Org-mode manual]] that
describes what they do:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Single keys can be made to execute commands when the cursor is at
 the beginning of a headline, i.e., before the first star.
#+END_QUOTE

To activate speed-keys, put this in your init-file:

: #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
:  (setq outshine-use-speed-commands t)
: #+END_SRC

Call `outshine-speed-command-help' to get an overview over the
available functionality and the keybindings.

Note that outshine works with 'imenu' (`outshine-imenu') and has
extra functionality to show the number of hidden lines in folded
headlines (`outshine-show-hidden-lines-cookies'). There are a few
utility commands for latex-mode too
(`outshine-latex-insert-header',
`outshine-latex-insert-headers-in-buffer' and
`outshine-TeX-command-region-on-subtree')

Extended Usage (outshine-use-outorg)

Outshine's basic usage is mostly based on its own implementation,
i.e. code from existing extensions to outline-minor-mode, new code
written for outshine, as well as code ported from Org-mode to
outshine.

Its extended use aims to make outshine headers more 'intelligent',
i.e. make them know about TODO items, tags, properties, dates and
times. This is done via the `outshine-use-outorg' function that
uses outorg to first convert an outshine buffer/subtree to
org-mode, then call an Org function on it, and finally convert the
edited buffer/subtree back to outshine. The outshine-use-outorg
concept turns outshine into a kind of org-minor-mode without
actually reimplementing Org functionality, just by reusing it with
the help of outorg.

This is still work in progress. Not all Org commands make sense in
an outshine buffer. Not all work out-of-the-box. Since there are
many Org commands, it will take some time to check them one-by-one
and filter out those that make sense with outshine (and fix them if
neccessary).

Emacs Version

Outshine works with GNU Emacs 24 or later. No attempts of testing
with older versions or other types of Emacs have been made (yet).

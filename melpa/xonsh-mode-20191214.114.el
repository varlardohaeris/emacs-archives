;;; Commentary:

;; This package implements a major mode to edit xonshrc files. The basic
;; functionality includes:
;;
;;    - Syntax highlight for xonsh operators
;;
;; Files with the .xonshrc or .xsh extension are automatically opened with
;; this mode.


;;; Code:

(require 'python)

(defvar xonsh-font-lock-keywords
  `(;; new keywords in xonsh language
    (,(regexp-opt '("xontrib" "load") 'words)
     1 font-lock-keyword-face)
    ;; C and Python types (highlight as builtins)
    (,(regexp-opt '("aliases") 'words)
     1 font-lock-builtin-face)
    ;; $ENV business
    (,(rx (* (any " \t"))
          (group "\$" (1+ (or word ?_
                              (0+ "." (1+ (or word ?_)))))))
     (1 font-lock-type-face)))
  "Additional font lock keywords for xonsh mode.")

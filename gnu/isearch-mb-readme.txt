This package provides an alternative Isearch UI based on the
minibuffer.  This allows editing the search string in arbitrary
ways without any special maneuver; unlike standard Isearch, cursor
motion commands do not end the search.  Moreover, in comparison
with standard Isearch, this package provides simplified visual
feedback in the echo area.

To use the package, simply activate `isearch-mb-mode'.

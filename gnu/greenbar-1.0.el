;;; Commentary:

;; For some of us old neck beards who learned to write software on
;; pucch cards and print out our code and output on wide line
;; printers.  When reading long rows of text across a 14 7/8" page it
;; was helpful to have alternating bands of subtle background coloring
;; to guide your eyes across the line.  This is also referred to as
;; `zebra striping` and is enabled in on PostScript output in
;; `ps-print.el' by enabling the `ps-zebra-stripes' setting.

;; To enable `greenbar-mode' in your `comint-mode' buffers, add the
;; following to your Emacs configuration:

;;     (add-hook 'comint-mode-hook #'greenbar-mode)

;; If you want to enable `greenbar-mode' only in a single mode derived
;; from `comint-mode', then you need to add `greenbar-mode' only to
;; the desired derive mode hook.  Adding `greenbar-mode' to
;; `comint-mode-hook' enables it for all comint derived modes.

;; The variable `greenbar-color-theme' is a list of predefined bar
;; background colors.  Each element of the list is a list: the first
;; member of which is a symbol that is the name of the theme; the rest
;; of the list are color names which are used as background colors for
;; successive bands of lines.

;; The variable `greenbar-color-list' controls which set of color bars
;; are to be applied.  The value is either a name from color theme
;; defined in `greenbar-color-themes' or it is a list of color names.

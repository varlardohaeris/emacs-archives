This package provides libraries for working with vCard data: files
representing contact information.  At present there are two parts
to it: a major mode for looking at *.vcf files, and a library for
parsing those files into elisp data structures.  The third part,
eventually, will be a library for writing elisp data structures to
*.vcf files.

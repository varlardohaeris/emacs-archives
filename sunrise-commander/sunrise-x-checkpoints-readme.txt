   Checkpoints extension for the Sunrise Commander file manager.

This package is an enhancement for the Sunrise Commander, which is a
two-pane file manager, like Midnight Commander or Total Commander.

The extension allows Sunrise to define and use a special kind of
bookmarks, known as "checkpoints", which store the location of both
panes at the same time.

  MS-Windows-specific utilities for the Sunrise Commander File Manager.

This package is an enhancement for the Sunrise Commander, which is a
two-pane file manager, like Midnight Commander or Total Commander.

This extension implements a listing of all Windows drives and special
folders inside the Sunrise Commander, as well as support for *.lnk
shortcuts for all file system operations inside Sunrise. Only standard
Windows shortcuts are currently supported.

WARNING! this extension is targeted at Emacs ports that run directly
on the Windows file system (like EmacsW32 and... are there any
others?) if yours is running on top of some simulation layer (like
Cygwin does) that maps the file system this code is of no use to you.

This is a major-mode for Emacs to view systemd's journalctl output in Emacs.
The output is split into chunks for performance reasons.
Fontification is provided and may be customized.
At the moment it is still in very early development.  Please give feedback on any problems that occure.

Put journalctl-mode.el in your load-path and add   ( require 'journalctl-mode)  to your .Emacs file.

 This package turns bibtex-completion functions into completing-read-based
 Emacs commands.  When used with selectrum/icomplete-vertical, embark, and
 marginalia, it provides similar functionality to helm-bibtex and ivy-bibtex:
 quick filtering and selecting of bibliographic entries from the minibuffer,
 and the option to run different commands against them.

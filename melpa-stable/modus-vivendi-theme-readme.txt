This theme is designed for colour-contrast accessibility.

1. Provide a consistent minimum contrast ratio between background and
foreground values of 7:1 or higher.  This meets the highest such
accessibility criterion per the guidelines of the Worldwide Web
Consortium's Working Group on Accessibility (WCAG AAA standard).

2. Offer as close to full face coverage as possible.  The list is
already quite long, with more additions to follow.

Note though, that it is difficult to create theme styles without
actually using the packages/interfaces that require them.  The output
of `list-faces-display' offers all we need to get started.  As such,
the development of this theme will be incremental, gradually
incorporating the customisations for packages I use or have been
exposed to.

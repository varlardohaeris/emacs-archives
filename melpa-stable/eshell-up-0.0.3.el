;;; Commentary:

;; Package for quickly navigating to a specific parent directory in
;; eshell without having to repeatedly typing 'cd ..'.  This is
;; achieved using the 'eshell-up' function, which can be bound to an
;; eshell alias such as 'up'.  As an example, assume that the current
;; working directory is:
;;
;; /home/user/first/second/third/fourth/fifth $
;;
;; Now, in order to quickly go to (say) the directory named 'first' one
;; simply executes:
;;
;; /home/user/first/second/third/fourth/fifth $ up fir
;; /home/user/first $
;;
;; This command searches the current working directory from right to
;; left for a directory that matches the user's input ('fir' in this
;; case).  If a match is found then eshell changes to that directory,
;; otherwise it does nothing.
;;
;; Other uses:
;;
;; It is also possible to compute the matching parent directory
;; without changing to it.  This is achieved using the 'eshell-up-peek'
;; function, which can be bound to an alias such as 'pk'.  When this
;; function is used in combination with subshells the matching parent
;; directory can be passed as an argument to other
;; functions.  Returning to the previous example one can (for example)
;; list the contents of 'first' by executing:
;;
;; /home/user/first/second/third/fourth/fifth $ ls {pk fir}
;; <directory contents>
;; ...
;;
;; It is recommended to invoke 'eshell-up' or 'eshell-up-peek' using
;; aliases as done in the examples above.  To do that, add the
;; following to your .eshell.aliases file:
;;
;; alias up eshell-up $1
;; alias pk eshell-up-peek $1
;;
;; This package is inspired by 'bd', which uses bash to implement
;; similar functionality.

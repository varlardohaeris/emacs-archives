;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides anonymous function literals for Emacs-Lisp.

;; Unfortunately anonymous function literals won't be added to Emacs
;; anytime soon.  The arguments as to why we would like to have that
;; has been layed out convincingly but the proposal has been rejected
;; anyway.

;; Several packages exist that implement anonymous function literals,
;; but until now they all either are waiting for a patch to the C part
;; be merged into Emacs, or they depart too far from the ideal syntax.

;; In a stroke of luck I discovered a loophole that allows us to have
;; almost the syntax that we want without having to convince anyone.
;;
;;   $(foo %)        is what I would have used if it were up to me.
;;   #(foo %)        works just as well for me.
;;   ##(foo %)       is similar enough to that.
;;   (##foo %)       is the loophole that I discovered.

;; Even though there is no space between the second # and `foo', this
;; last form is read as a list with three arguments (## foo %) and it
;; is also indented the way we want!
;;
;;   (##foo %
;;          bar)

;; This is good enough for me, but with a bit of font-lock trickery,
;; we can even get it to be display like this:
;;
;;   ##(foo %
;;          bar)
;;
;; This is completely optional and you have to opt-in by enabling
;; `llama-mode' (or the global variant `global-llama-mode').

;; An unfortunate edge-case exists that you have to be aware off; if
;; no argument is placed on the same line as the function, then Emacs
;; does not indent as we would want it too:
;;
;;   (##foo                                         ##(foo
;;    bar)        which llama-mode displays as       bar)

;; I recommend that in this case you simply write this instead:
;;
;;   (## foo                                        ##( foo
;;       bar)     which llama-mode displays as          bar)

;; It is my hope that this package helps to eventually get similar
;; syntax into Emacs itself, by demonstrating that this is useful and
;; that people want to use it.

(defmacro ## (fn &rest args)
    "Return an anonymous function.

The returned function calls the function FN with arguments ARGS
and returns its value.

The arguments of the outer function are determined recursively
from ARGS.  Each symbol from `%1' through `%9' that appears in
ARGS is treated as a positional argument.  Missing arguments
are named `_%N', which keeps the byte-compiler quiet.  `%' is
a shorthand for `%1'; only one of these can appear in ARGS.
`%*' represents extra `&rest' arguments.

Instead of:

  (lambda (a _ c &rest d)
    (foo a (bar c) d))

you can use this macro and write:

  (##foo % (bar %3) %*)

which expands to:

  (lambda (% _%2 %3 &rest %*)
    (foo % (bar %3) %*))

Note that there really does not have to be any whitespace
between \"##\" and \"foo\"!

If you enable `llama-mode' or `global-llama-mode', then the
above is *displayed* as:

  ##(foo % (bar %3) %*)"

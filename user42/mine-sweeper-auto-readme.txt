;;; Commentary:

;; This package extends mine-sweeper.el with a `mine-auto' function to go
;; around the board marking or opening squares the same as you might do
;; manually, but automated.
;;
;; Only safe moves are made, but the algorithms are fairly basic and
;; probably don't detect all possible safe moves.

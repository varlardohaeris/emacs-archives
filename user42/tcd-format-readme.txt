;;; Commentary:

;; This code sets up human-readable decode of XTide .tcd tide constituent
;; database files using the `buffer-file-format' mechanism and the
;; restore_tide_db program from XTide tcd-utils,
;;
;;     https://www.flaterco.com/xtide/files.html#extras
;;
;; It's only meant for browsing tcd files if you don't have the source
;; handy.  There's no support for re-writing a .tcd file.
;;
;; For more on XTide see <http://www.flaterco.com/xtide>.
;; And see xtide.el for running it within Emacs

;;; Commentary:

;; `M-x tex-increase' and `M-x tex-decrease' increase or decrease various
;; size macros for TeX and LaTeX.  For example \bigl( increase to \Bigl(.
;;
;; Similar can be found in `YaTeX-change-parentheses', but it has read-char
;; for desired new size whereas tex-increase just goes a size up or down.
;; tex-increase has font sizes and some skips increase or decrease too
;; (see `tex-increase-lists' for all).

;;; Commentary:

;; `M-x tex-increase' and `M-x tex-decrease' increase or decrease various
;; size macros for TeX and LaTeX.  For example
;;
;;     \bigl(    --->    \Bigl(
;;
;; Similar can be found in `YaTeX-change-parentheses', but it has
;; `read-char' for desired new size whereas tex-increase just goes a size up
;; or down.  tex-increase has font sizes and some skips to increase or
;; decrease too.  sEE `tex-increase-lists' for all the forms.

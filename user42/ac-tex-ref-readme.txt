;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This is an auto-complete.el add-on with completion sources for label
;; names in LaTeX \ref{} and \cite{}.
;;
;; Label names and cite names are found from \label{} and \bibitem{} in the
;; current buffer.  There's no support for multi-file documents.  (AUCTeX
;; and RefTeX have things for that, and for new label creating macros too.)

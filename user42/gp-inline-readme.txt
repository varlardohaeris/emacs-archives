;;; Commentary:

;; `M-x gp-inline-defines' runs Pari/GP code in GP-DEFINE lines of the
;; current buffer.  `M-x gp-inline-eval' runs a single line of Pari/GP code,
;; with or without such a prefix.  Both send the code to the GP sub-process
;; of PariEmacs pari.el (`M-x gp').  See the docstrings for more.

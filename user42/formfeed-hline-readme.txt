;;; Commentary:

;; `M-x formfeed-hline-mode' global minor mode displays control-L formfeeds
;; as a horizontal line like
;;
;;     ^L-------------------------------------
;;
;; The dashes follow the window width and the face is `escape-glyph' like
;; the default ^L display.  The ^L is still shown so it's familiar and
;; hopefully can't be confused with a literal line of dashes.  See the
;; docstring in `formfeed-hline-mode' below for more.

Extensions to `re-builder.el'.

You can match the regular-expression to target region when you use
this extension.
And it provides some commands.

Thanks to elim for advice about symbol-function.

Installation:

Put re-builder+.el to your load-path.
The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))

And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.

(require 're-builder+)

No need more.

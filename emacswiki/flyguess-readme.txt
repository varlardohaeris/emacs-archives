 Brand new version of flyspell-guess. It uses a new sampling algorithm that
 boosts guess speed and accuracy.

Installation:

 Load it as usual, ie. put this file in the Emacs-Lisp load path and add the
 following to your dot-emacs startup file:

    (require 'flyguess)

 This way flyguess will load every time you start Emacs; the insinuation of
 the guess indicator is now automatic so that's really it.

Usage: M-x osg, then start typing

Select from the matches with up/down/pgup/pgdown and press enter
to go that location
(you can navigate the history with M-p/M-n)

If the search string contains several strings separated by spaces then
these substrings can appear in any order in the results.

The search handles an org heading and its text as one block, so
the substrings can match in any part of an org entry.

If the heading is not matching, only the body, the heading is added
to the results anyway to indicate which entry is matched.

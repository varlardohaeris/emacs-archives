erc-tex is a tiny ERC module which render LaTeX mathematical expressions
in your ERC chats. You will need both latex and dvipng in order to use this
module.

Once erc-tex is avalaible for your Emacs, you can use `erc-tex-mode' to
toggle the module. This will render the text between $...$ as a LaTeX
expression. Indeed, you can use `erc-tex-image-edit', bound to `RET' on TeX
formulas to edit the TeX code in the prompt and resend the image.

After several times wishing for the Perl Date::Calc module in
elisp, I finally decided to just re-write the code.  I'm not done
yet; however, I wanted to get something "published" sooner rather
than later.  I'll continue working on this as I can.  It's
important to me.  This will serve as a stepping stone to writing an
iCalendar/iTIP (rfc 2445, 2446) compliant scheduler.  If you have
any problems with the interface to this code, let me know.  I'm
certainly willing to be flexible.  What I really want is the
functionality.  I'm not too hung up on the actual interface.

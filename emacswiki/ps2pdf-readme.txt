Just a small hack I did while playing with GhostScript, trying to
create PDF files from PostScript files.

It does little more than the ps2pdf script that comes with
GhostScript.  Some handy functions to create PDF files from Emacs
buffers are provided though.

If you use Windows you probably don't have GhostScript
installed.  Get it from here: http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/.  Make
sure you get one of the "GPL Ghostscript" versions.

Tested under Windows XP and Mandriva GNU/Linux Free 2007.

This file is an unofficial add-on to Michael Kifer's Viper-mode.
It provides vi-like keymaps for various major modes, including
emacs-lisp-mode, lisp-mode, lisp-interaction-mode, slime-repl-mode,
LaTeX-mode, haskell-mode, prolog-mode and ruby-mode. If you have
any questions or comments, please e-mail the authors and the
maintainer.

Load the package with:

(require 'viper-in-more-modes)

This is alpha-quality code. If it works for you, let us know.

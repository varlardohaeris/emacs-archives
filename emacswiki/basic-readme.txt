An editing mode for basic code.  It knows a lot about visual basic and
tries to provide proper indentation and syntax highlighting.  This
version is fairly crude.  It provides syntax highlighting and
indentation.

WISH LIST:

 I would very much like to automatically append a "_" at the end of a
 line that gets overflown in auto-fill-mode.  I'll leave that to a
 later version.

 I would also like to append the proper block end when the user
 presses enter at a block beginning.  For example, if the
 user typed a "for" statement, the ending "next" statement would be
 automatically added when the user pressed enter.

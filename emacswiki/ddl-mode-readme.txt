DDL is Tandem's DATA DEFINITION Language.

Keywords as of G06.05 are recognized by this version of ddl-mode.

imenu recognizes ?section <name> and ?page <name> declarations as
  well as the expected RECORD <name>. & DEFINITION <name>. lines.

Both ! and * style comments are handled correctly (I think).

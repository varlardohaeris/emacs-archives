IMAPUA is an alternative to the GNUS news reader for imap based mail stores.
It offers a UI which might be more intuitive to regular IMAP users than
the GNUs UI.

Most things that you want to do with a mailer are pretty much there but most
need more polishing. Here's a brief feature list:

- folder creation
- folder deletion
- open a message
- delete a message
- purge a folder
- move a message

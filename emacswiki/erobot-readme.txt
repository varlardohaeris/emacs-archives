This game implements a very basic version of the many robot variants
out there.  Players compete by writing a defun (called candidates,
erobots, or ebots).  The last ebot remaining wins the game.  Start
the game with `erobot'.

Bugs: No multiple copies of the same defun allowed (use defalias or
fset to create copies)

Testing the game: Run `erobot-tour'.
